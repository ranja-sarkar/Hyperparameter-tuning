# Optimizing ML models

When it comes to minimizing costs in a business, what we need is an optimized model, so that the model is as effective as possible to achieve the business objective it has been built for.

The main techniques of optimizing model hyper-parameters are **random search**, **grid search**, and **Bayesian search**.

These are discussed in details in **Chapter 9** of my book.

The very premise of machine learning relies on a form of function optimization so inputs csn be almost accurately mapped to expected output. 
Bayesian optimization is best when the objective function is complex. This process keeps updating the hyperparameter config. until an optimal point (global minimum) is reached in the search space.
