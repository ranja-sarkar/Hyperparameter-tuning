# Optimizing ML models

When it comes to minimizing costs in a business, what we need is an optimized model, so that the model is as effective as possible to achieve the business objective it has been built for.
The main techniques of optimizing model hyper-parameters are **random search**, **grid search**, and **Bayesian search**.
These are discussed in details in **Chapter 9** of my book.
